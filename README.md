# Diabetes-patients-classification

A project to explore classification algorithms. Uses KNN, SVM, Logistic regression, and other algorithms to predict whether a patient will be diagnosed with diabetes or not.

- In this notebook, I am applying supervised machine learning classifications to a diabetic dataset. I aim to conclude whether the tested data has diabetes or not. I will use KNN , decision tree , random forest ,Support vector machine, logistic regression and Naive Bayes algorithms. I will also make evaluation of all the models used by using confusion matrix.
